> Windows Forms animation library used in [HolzShots](https://github.com/nikeee/HolzShots).

A library for animated UI transitions for Windows Forms.

This is the an independent hard-fork of the original library [hosted on Google Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105235124/https://code.google.com/p/dot-net-transitions/), since the original author has discontinued the development of this library.

There are similar projects keeping this awesome library alive. These are:
