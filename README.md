===============

A library for animated UI transitions for .NET

This is the an independent hard-fork of the original library [hosted on Google Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105235124/https://code.google.com/p/dot-net-transitions/), since the original author has discontinued the development of this library.


The aim of this project is to improve the architechture and make it compliant to the [Class Library Guidelines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms229042.aspx).
Feel free to request enhancements.
